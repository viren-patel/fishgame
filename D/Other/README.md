# XGui:
XGui is a shell executable Python script which takes in a positive integer (size in pixels) and renders a window containing a hexagon with width 3 * size and height 2 * size. If you click within the hexagon, the window will close.
### Prerequisites

* Python 3 - Double check that your python executable or symlink exists at /usr/bin/python3. If it doesn't, you will need to update the first line in xyes with the path to your python installation.
* Tkinter for Python 3
### Usage
Render window containing hexagon with size set to 100 pixels

```./xgui 100```
