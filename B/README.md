# XYes:
XYes is a shell executable Python variant of the popular Linux command tool 'yes'. Much like 'yes', 'xyes' combines all arguments provided into a single string and displays the string an infinite number of times.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 - Double check that your python executable or symlink exists at /usr/bin/python3. If it doesn't, you will need to update the first line in xyes with the path to your python installation.
