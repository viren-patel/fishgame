## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 1

### General

We will run self-evaluations for each milestone this semester.  The
graders will evaluate them for accuracy and completeness.

Every self-evaluation will go out into your Enterprise GitHub repo
within a short time afrer the milestone deadline, and you will have 24
hours to answer the questions and push back a completed form.

This one is a practice run to make sure you get


### Specifics


- does your analysis cover the following ideas:

  - the need for an explicit Interface specification between the (remote) AI
    players and the game system?
  Not really.  We were planning on having it within the Game functionality, but we didn't explicitly say that.



  - the need for a referee sub-system for managing individual games
  This is located within the "Game Subsystem"  It is not called referee but is the manager for an individual game


  - the need for a tournament management sub-system for grouping
    players into games and dispatching to referee components
    Yes.  Tournament subsystem fulfills this


- does your building plan identify concrete milestones with demo prototypes:

  - for running individual games
  Yes (Milestone 2. Second Sentence)



  - for running complete tournaments on a single computer
  Yes (Milestone 4: final Sentence)



  - for running remote tournaments on a network
  Yes (Milestone 5: Final sentence)




- for the English of your memo, you may wish to check the following:

  - is each paragraph dedicated to a single topic? does it come with a
    thesis statement that specifies the topic?
    Yes each paragraph covers a single topic.  There aren't really thesis statements.



  - do sentences make a point? do they run on?
  Yes. No.



  - do sentences connect via old words/new words so that readers keep
    reading?
    Yes?  I'm not too sure what this is asking.  If it is about flow the sentences do that.



  - are all sentences complete? Are they missing verbs? Objects? Other
    essential words?
    Yes. No.


  - did you make sure that the spelling is correct? ("It's" is *not* a
    possesive; it's short for "it is". "There" is different from
    "their", a word that is too popular for your generation.)
  Yes.


The ideal feedback are pointers to specific senetences in your memo.
For PDF, the paragraph/sentence number suffices.

For **code repos**, we will expect GitHub line-specific links.
