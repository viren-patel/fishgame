## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 5

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin placements for setups 

None, our place penguins method actually took in a state and modifies it in place by placing 
each penguin. Therefore, because we modified it in place, we did not foresee the need to return the
actual penguin placements and include a data interpretation for penguin placements.

- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 

https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bigsandy/blob/166af2004d11f13ecb9c309032feb5f1077cf71f/Fish/Common/Tests/test_strategy.py#L38

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths

- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:

  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`

  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bigsandy/blob/166af2004d11f13ecb9c309032feb5f1077cf71f/Fish/Common/game_tree.py#L80

  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`

  https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/bigsandy/blob/166af2004d11f13ecb9c309032feb5f1077cf71f/5/xtree#L25

  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules
